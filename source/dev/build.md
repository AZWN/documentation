# Building Spoofax

This section describes how to build Spoofax from scratch, on the command-line.

## Supported platforms

OSX, Linux, and Windows are supported.

## Requirements

1. **Git 1.8.2 or higher** is required to check out the source code from our GitHub repositories. Instructions on how to install Git for your platform can be found here: <http://git-scm.com/downloads>. If you run OSX and have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed, you can install Git by executing `brew install git`. Confirm your Git installation by executing `git version`.
2. **Maven 3.3.9 or higher** is required to build Spoofax and StrategoXT, refer to the [Setting up Maven](maven.md) section for instructions on how to install Maven.
3. **MetaBorg Maven artifacts** are required since the build depends on artifacts from previous builds for bootstrapping purposes. Follow [Using MetaBorg Maven artifacts](maven.md) to make these artifacts available to Maven.
4. **Python 3.4 or higher** is used to orchestrate the build. Instructions on how to install Python for your platform can be found here: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>. If you run OSX and have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed, you can install Python by executing `brew install python3`. Confirm your Python installation by executing `python3 --version`.
5. **Pip 7.0.3 or higher** is used to download some python dependencies. A version comes preinstalled with Python 3, but you need to make sure that you have version 7.0.3 or higher. To upgrade to the newest version use `pip install --upgrade pip` or `pip3 install --upgrade pip`, depending on if your OS uses a different pip for Python 3. Confirm using `pip --version` or `pip3 --version`.

## Cloning the source code

Clone the source code from the [spoofax-releng](https://github.com/metaborg/spoofax-releng) repository with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/metaborg/spoofax-releng.git
cd spoofax-releng
git submodule update --init --remote --recursive
```

Cloning and updating submodules can take a while, since we have many submodules and some have a large history.

## Building

To build Spoofax, simply execute:

```bash
./b build all
```

This downloads the latest StrategoXT, and builds Spoofax. If you also want to build StrategoXT from scratch, execute:

```bash
./b build -st all
```

The `-s` flag build StrategoXT instead of downloading it, and `-t` skips the StrategoXT tests since they are very lengthy.
The `all` part of the command indicates that we want to build all components. If you would only like to build the Java components of Spoofax, and skip the Eclipse plugins, execute:

```bash
./b build java
```

Use `./b build` to get a list of components available for building, and `./b build --help` for help on all the command-line flags and switches.

```eval_rst
.. note:: If you have opened a project in the repository in Eclipse, you **must turn off** :menuselection:`Project --> Build Automatically` in Eclipse, otherwise the Maven and Eclipse compilers will interfere and possibly fail the build. After the Maven build is finished, enable :guilabel:`Build Automatically` again.
```

## Updating the source code

If you want to update the repository and submodules, execute:

```bash
git pull --rebase
./b checkout
./b update
```

The `git pull` command will update any changes in the main repository. The `./b checkout` command will check out the correct branches in all submodules, because Git does not do this automatically. The `./b update` command will update all submodules.

## Switching to a different branch

Switching to a different branch, for example the `spoofax-release` branch, is done with the following commands:

```bash
git checkout spoofax-release
git pull --rebase
git submodule update --init --remote --recursive
./b checkout
./b update
```

## Troubleshooting

### Resetting and cleaning

If updating or checking out a branch of submodule fails (because of unstaged or conflicting changes), you can try to resolve it yourself, or you can reset and clean everything. Reset and clean all submodules using:

```bash
./b reset
./b clean
```

```eval_rst
.. warning:: Resetting and cleaning DELETES UNCOMMITTED AND UNPUSHED CHANGES, which can cause PERMANENT DATA LOSS. Make sure all your changes are committed and pushed!
```

### Weird compilation errors

If you get any weird compilation errors during the build, make sure that <span class='menuselection'>Project â€£ Build Automatically</span> is turned off in Eclipse.

## IntelliJ plugin

The IntelliJ plugin is currently built separately from the spoofax-releng repository and build scripts.
To build the IntelliJ IDEA Spoofax plugin locally, you first need to get the source [from GitHub][1].
Choose one of the branches:

* [`master` branch][2]: stable build of current release. ([ZIP][4])
* [`develop` branch][3]: unstable build for next release. ([ZIP][5])

Either clone the repository locally or download and extract the ZIP archive.

Next you need to invoke Gradle to build the project.
Simply execute the following command from the main project's root folder (i.e. <span class='file'>org.metaborg.intellij/</span>):

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```
(On Windows `gradlew clean build`.)

Alternatively, you can import the project in IntelliJ and build it from there.
