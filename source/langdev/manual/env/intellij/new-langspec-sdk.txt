.. note:: If the *Project SDK* displays *<None>* and you can't select the
   Metaborg SDK, then you need to add it first.

   1. Click the *New...* button next to the *Project SDK* field.

   2. You may get a warning if you have no Java JDK configured. Click *OK*
      and configure the JDK's home location. The suggested home
      directory is usually correct. Click *OK*.

   3. Select a home directory for the Metaborg SDK. The default is the
      Spoofax plugin's ``lib/`` folder, which is sufficient as it contains
      all the core dependencies.

   4. Click *OK*.
