Syntax Definition with SDF3
================================

The syntax definition defines the structure of programs and a mapping from program texts to abstract syntax trees. 
The SDF3 Syntax Definition Formalism allows language designers to focus on the structure of programs rather than on debugging parser implementations by means of the following features: support for the full class of context-free grammars by means of generalized LR parsing, integration of lexical and context-free syntax through scannerless parsing, safe and complete disambiguation using priority and associativity declarations, an automatic mapping from parse trees to abstract syntax trees through integrated constructor declarations, automatic generation of formatters based on template productions, syntactic completion proposals in editors.
