Stratego Tutorial/Reference
===========================

This documentation is closely based on the Stratego Tutorial and Reference Manual that was developed for Stratego/XT 0.17. While the basic explanation of the language is up-to-date, this manual makes liberal use of a tool called the "Stratego Shell," which is not currently provided as part of Spoofax. However, in many cases there are guidelines for running similar examples in the Spoofax Eclipse interface, and pointers to a working project that contains many of the examples.
