# Spoofax 2.0.0 Migration

This migration guide describes the differences between Spoofax 1.5 and 2.0 and describes the steps to convert an older Spoofax project to Spoofax 2.0 project.

To gather the required knowledge for migrating a language project, go through the documentation in the following order:

1. getting started, to install and use Spoofax 2.0
2. 2.0 notes, for an overview of the changes
3. this document, for the concrete changes and steps to port

## Differences

### Terminology

language specification

language component

language implementation

language

language specification project

end-user project

### General

project structure

generated files

### Eclipse

#### Projects

Both language specification and end-user projects (i.e. a project with object language files) are treated differently in Spoofax 2.0.

Language specification projects are no longer Eclipse plugins so that they can be used outside of the Eclipse platform as well.

##### Importing

To import a language specification project into Eclipse, use `Import... -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects`. We use Maven to set up the correct Java dependencies, which is why there is no special 'Existing Spoofax Projects' importer.

##### Builds

Eclipse has the concept of incremental project builders, which incrementally parse, analyze, and compile files inside a project. An example of such a project builder is the Eclipse JDT builder which incrementally builds Java files. Spoofax 1.5  did not use this functionality, but the new Eclipse plugin in Spoofax 2.0 does.

The project builder for Spoofax parses, analyses, executes transformations, and shows all error markers, for all language files (Stratego files, SDF3 files, files of your language, etc.) in the project. If the project is opened for the first time, a full build will occur, building all language files. When changes occur in the project, an incremental build occurs, building only changed files.

The commands under the `Project` menu in Eclipse now also affect Spoofax projects.
Executing `Project -> Build...` (or pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+B`) will build the project.
Executing `Project -> Clean...` will delete the `.cache` directory, reset the index and task engine, remove all error markers, and reanalyze and rebuild all files in the project. This makes the `Reset and Reanalyze` builder unnecessary, since this is now properly integrated with Eclipse.
Automatic building can also be turned off by disabling `Project -> Build Automatically`. Builds will then only occur if `Project -> Build Project` is executed or if `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+B` is pressed.

Furthermore, the language specification build is no longer written in Ant, but in Java using the [Pluto](http://pluto-build.github.io/) incremental build system.

##### Natures

The Spoofax language specification project builder is not enabled by default, to enable it a 'Spoofax meta nature' must be added to the project. A nature in Eclipse is a project tag which enables functionality for that project. To add the Spoofax nature to a project, right click the project, and choose `Spoofax (meta) -> Add Spoofax meta nature`.
When importing a language specification, this nature is automatically added.

For end-user projects, right click the project, and choose `Spoofax -> Add Spoofax nature` to add a nature for end-user projects.

Editors will parse and analyze files regardless of there being a Spoofax nature, but the on-save handler will not be called.

#### Builders

Builders for the open editor are now located in the `Spoofax` main menu instead of buttons on the tool bar. Builders wait for the analyzed AST if needed, so the issue where builders are sometimes not executed on the analyzed AST should be solved now.

Builders can also be executed on a set of files by selecting the files in the project or package explorer, right clicking the files, selecting the language name from the menu, and then selecting a builder.

#### Cancellation

Editor updates can now be cancelled by clicking the red stop button in the progress view. If the progress view is not visible, you can open it by choosing `Window -> Show View -> Progress`. If the editor update is not responsive (it is looping for example), the thread running the editor update will be killed after a while.

Killing a thread during analysis may leave the index and task engine in an inconsistent state. If this happens, clean the project using `Project -> Clean...` to force a full build, which makes the state consistent again. Killing a thread is not very well supported in Java and may break Eclipse or even the JVM, which then requires a restart.

Project builds and transformations can also be cancelled in the progress view.

#### Console logging

Console logging in the new plugin is more prominent so that we can diagnose problems more easily. If the console is not visible, you can open it by choosing `Window -> Show View -> Console`. The console does not automatically pop-up when there is a message any more, so it can also be hidden by just closing it.

All warning and error messages are also sent to Eclipse's error log. The error log can sometimes contain more information about exceptions and stack traces in errors. If the error log is not visible, you can open it by choosing `Window -> Show View -> Error Log`.

#### Manually loading/unloading a language

A language can be manually loaded or reloaded by right clicking a project and choosing `Spoofax (meta) -> Load language`, and unloaded with `Spoofax (meta) -> Unload language`.

#### External dependencies

The new plugin does not depend on a modified version of IMP, making it possible to install the Rascal plugin alongside the Spoofax plugin. All other external dependencies are limited to the Spoofax plugin, which should prevent conflicts with other Eclipse plugins.

## Converting a project

conversion vs new project + copy pasting

Spoofax 2.0 supports converting an old Spoofax project into a Spoofax 2.0 project, but some conversions need to be done manually.

```eval_rst
.. warning:: Converting a Spoofax project is a destructive operation, some files will be deleted, replaced, or changed. Make a backup of your projects before doing any conversions!
```

First, import your existing Spoofax project into Eclipse using `File -> Import... -> Existing Projects into Workspace`. Right click the project, and choose `Spoofax (meta) â†’ Upgrade language project`. A wizard screen will pop up where you have to fill in some details about your language.

If a `packed.esv` file was found, Spoofax will try to fill in some fields for you. If not, all fields need to be filled in manually. The id and name of your language can be found in the main ESV file. It is important that these values match exactly, otherwise the conversion will go wrong.
For group id, use a Maven identifier for your organization (e.g. org.metaborg), and as version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT. Press finish to convert the language project.

Unfortunately, not all required conversions can be done automatically. Do the following conversions manually:
