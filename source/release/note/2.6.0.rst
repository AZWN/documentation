Changes
-------

Overall
~~~~~~~

- Added support for getting the selected term in Stratego builders/transformations. In the builder tuple ``(node, _, ast, path, projectPath)``, the first term (``node``) is now the selected term when a builder is executed in the context of an editor with a selection. The term is selected by finding the outermost term that has an origin that fits in the selection.

Parser
~~~~~~

- Added an incremental variant of the JSGLR2 parser.
