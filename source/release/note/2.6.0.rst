=============
Spoofax 2.6.0
=============

This is a stub for the release notes of Spoofax 2.6.0.

See the corresponding :ref:`migration guide <2.6.0-migration-guide>` for migrating from Spoofax 2.5.0 to Spoofax 2.6.0.

Changes
-------

Parser
~~~~~~

- Added two experimental variants to the JSGLR2 parser: ``recovery`` and ``recovery-incremental``.
- Added Unicode support to the JSGLR1 and JSGLR2 parsers. The meta-languages themselves do not support Unicode yet, because they are bootstrapped with and old version of SDF3. However, other languages built with Spoofax can use Unicode.

FlowSpec
~~~~~~~~

Bugfix: Names with namespaces were broken in an earlier version during performance optimization. The error would like: ``java.lang.AssertionError: Unrecognised Namespace: Namespace("Var")``.

Stratego
~~~~~~~~

Stratego separate compilation is now switched to the new system. It no longer has any limitations that were previously mentioned. Do note that separate compilation will give the same stricter error messages that the editor does: You need to import anything you use, you cannot use something that another module imports that imports your module.
