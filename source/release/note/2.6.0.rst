Changes
-------

Overall
~~~~~~~

- Added support for getting the selected term in Stratego builders/transformations. In the builder tuple ``(node, _, ast, path, projectPath)``, the first term (``node``) is now the selected term when a builder is executed in the context of an editor with a selection. The term is selected by finding the outermost term that has an origin that fits in the selection.
- Fixed a bug that prevented source transformations from being run if context or analysis were missing.
- Changed constraint analyzer to support more multi-file scnearios.

Parser
~~~~~~

- Added an incremental variant of the JSGLR2 parser.

NaBL2
~~~~~

- Improved preformance of AST resolution lookups.

Statix (experimental)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed bugs and improved performance.

Eclipse
~~~~~~~

- Added a lifecycle mapping that adds a Spoofax nature to an imported spoofax-project.
