Changes
-------

Stratego
~~~~~~~~

The incremental compiler for Stratego landed in this release. It is documented as a separate item under the Stratego documentation, including instructions on how to opt-in to it and what its limitations are.

The Stratego primitives ``all``, ``some`` and ``one`` sometimes lost annotations and origins of list tails when an element in the list was transformed. This bug has been fixed.
