# Spoofax 2.0.0

Spoofax 2.0 is a complete rewrite of Spoofax which improves the architecture by separating Spoofax into the Spoofax Core API and implementations on top of that API, massively improves the language development workflow, and properly supports language composition.

See the corresponding [migration guide](../migrate/2.0.0.md) for migrating from Spoofax 1.5 to Spoofax 2.0.

## Architecture

The biggest change in Spoofax 2.0 is the architecture. Previously, Spoofax was built on top of the Eclipse and IMP platform, meaning Spoofax was not usable outside of the Eclipse platform. In Spoofax 2.0, all platform-agnostic functionality such as language management, parsing, analysis, transformation, and editor services, are implemented in  Spoofax Core, which is a portable Java library with an API. This means that the Spoofax language workbench, and any language implementations made with Spoofax, can now be used by any application, platform, or framework in the Java ecosystem.

## Integrations

We have integrated Spoofax Core with Eclipse, IntelliJ, Maven, and the command-line.

We support the Eclipse platform through a new plugin that integrates Spoofax Core as an Eclipse plugin. The new Eclipse plugin supports language development in Eclipse, and supports exporting languages made with Spoofax as an Eclipse plugin with full-fledged editor support. We have also performed a more faithful Eclipse integration than Spoofax 1.5 did. For example, we now use natures to enable Spoofax for a project, use the incremental builder framework to allow suspending automatic builds, and use Eclipse's menu system for builders instead of non-standard buttons. See the [migration guide](../migrate/2.0.0.md) for a full list of changes to the Eclipse plugin compared to Spoofax 1.5.

IntelliJ is now also a supported platform through the Eclipse IntelliJ plugin. Languages can be developed in IntelliJ, and exported as IntelliJ plugins with full-fledged editor support.

The Spoofax Maven plugin supports command-line builds and continuous integration of language implementations in Maven. Language implementations can be exported as Maven artifacts which can be depended on and used to build programs of that language.

Command-line use of language implementations is supported through Sunshine's integration with Spoofax Core. Sunshine's command-line interface has been simplified to improve ease of use, and now also supports a server mode to reduce the high cost of starting a new JVM and loading a language.

Furthermore, anyone can make new integrations using the Core API.

## Language Development Workflow

There are several improvements to the language development workflow in Spoofax 2.0.

Almost all generated files are now generated to the `src-gen` directory of a language project. All required generated files are now (re)generated when building, so it is no longer necessary to commit generated files to source control. This results in much cleaner projects. Furthermore, the language build is now incremental, which speeds up the build in many cases.

The bootstrapping process of meta-languages has been significantly improved by versioning languages. It is now possible to load multiple versions of the same language implementation into Spoofax. Meta-languages are bootstrapped by building them against baseline versions of the meta-languages. When a meta-language under development breaks, it is possible to revert back to a previous version to get things working again.

##  Missing Features

A few features didn't make it to Spoofax 2.0, with the biggest one being completions.

Both syntactic and semantic completions were already very dodgy in Spoofax 1.5, only working in some specific cases. This is why we did not port the completion algorithm from Spoofax 1.5 to 2.0, and are instead working on a new completion algorithm that will be included in a future version.

The Spoofax modelware component was not ported to Spoofax 2.0 since we do not have the knowledge to port this component.

Folding, realtime builders, and the eclipse.ini check are minor features that are not implemented in 2.0, but may be implemented in the future.

A missing integration in Spoofax 2.0 is a Spoofax Gradle plugin, we are working on that integration for inclusion in a future version.
