Changes
-------

Overall
~~~~~~~

- The deprecated libraries and files from Spoofax 2.1.0 have been removed. If you have not done so yet, follow the :ref:`Spoofax 2.1.0 migration guide <2.1.0-migration-guide>` to migrate your project to the new Spoofax library.

Core API
~~~~~~~~

- Improve: `Spoofax/190 - Extend API for language discovery <http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/190>`_. This deprecates several methods in the language discovery API, see the :ref:`migration guide <2.2.0-migration-guide>` on how to migrate your code.
- Improve: `Spoofax/193 - Stratego warnings in Spoofax language projects with NaBL2 analysis <http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/193>`_. The excessive number of warnings from Stratego compilation are now filtered out.
- Fix: Path and project path that are passed to the editor hover strategy are now consistent with paths passed to other strategies.
- Fix: `Spoofax/187 - Provide simplified builder API <http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/187>`_.
- Fix: `Spoofax/188 - Java type error in documented language processing code <http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/188>`_.

Eclipse
~~~~~~~

- Improve: Added several switches to the :guilabel:`Spoofax (meta)` menu for disabling analyses and builds, to improve usability in cases where these operations are very slow.

NaBL2
~~~~~

- Introduces a new solver implementation with improved performance.
- Introduces separate signature sections for *constructors*, *relations*, and *functions*.
- Deprecates the *types* signature, which will be removed in the next release.

SPT
~~~

- Fix several origin tracking issues related to section markers.

DynSem
~~~~~~

- Fix analysis crashes on empty **rules** sections (`#161 <https://github.com/metaborg/dynsem/issues/161>`_)
- Support for abrupt termination: automatic expansion and propagation of read-write semantic components with default values
- Analysis performance improvements
