Changes
-------

Stratego
^^^^^^^^

Stratego received some small patches to improve user experience.

- Stratego editor now gives warnings when using ``left``, ``right`` and a couple of other variables names as these are also constructors in libstratego-sglr and interpreted as constructor match patterns. 
- When the Stratego compiler generates names for code generation, these now start with the source code name if available or with a constant name related to the language feature (e.g. a ``where(s)`` is turned into ``?where243;s;!where243``). Since some generated names turn up in a stack trace from a Stratego, this should improve readability of the stack trace. Complex closures are still named ``lifted26``, as the compiler cannot replace humans in propertly naming things. 

SPT
^^^

Problems related to escaping in string terms of expectations are fixed:

- Double quotes (``"``) in expectation require escaping using backslashes, but were not unescaped when comparing with actual parse results. This made correct tests containing double quotes in strings fail. This is fixed by unescaping the expectation terms.
- Formatting expectation terms as strings was different than default ATerms (``"`` and ``\`` were not escaped), which was confusing when a test fails and the actual and expected terms were reported. This is fixed by aligning the SPT expectation terms formatting with default ATerm formatting.
