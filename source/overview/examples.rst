Here we collect a list of (pointers to) languages developed with Spoofax. Not all projects have publicly available sources. Let us know if you know of more projects to list here.

MetaBorg
-----------------

Spoofax is bootstrapped; all meta-languages used in Spoofax are developed in Spoofax. You can find the repositories of these languages along with the Spoofax run-time system on the `MetaBorg <https://github.com/metaborg>`_ organization on github.
The  :ref:`introduction to Spoofax development section <dev-intro>` provides an overview of these repositories.

Spoofax in Education
----------------------

We use Spoofax in a `compiler construction course at TU Delft <https://tudelft-in4303-2016.github.io/>`_. The two main example languages used in that course are Mini Java and Tiger:

Mini Java
  An object-oriented example language, subset of Java. The sources are not published since our students need to produce this. But you can follow `the assignments <https://tudelft-in4303-2016.github.io/assignments/>`_.
   
Tiger
  A functional example language based on Appel's book. The `metaborg-tiger <https://github.com/MetaBorgCube/metaborg-tiger>`_ repository provides a complete definition of syntax in SDF3, static semantics in NaBL2, and dynamic semantics in DynSem.

MetaBorgCube
-----------------

The `MetaBorgCube <https://github.com/metaborgcube>`_ github organization is a collection of language projects developed with Spoofax. Here is a selection:

CERN Code Gen
  A DSL for generation of PLC code <https://github.com/MetaBorgCube/cern-languages>
