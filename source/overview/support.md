Spoofax is an open source project. We welcome contributions from the community. 

Spoofax is developed by the TU Delft Programming Languages group. 
We do our best to make Spoofax usable by everyone and to help you when you encounter issues. 
However, our resources are limited, so please be patient.

## Documentation

This documentation is the intended to be the first source of information on all things Spoofax.
So, please read carefully.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

To report bugs or request new features use our [YellowGrass](http://yellowgrass.org/) issue trackers:

* http://yellowgrass.org/project/Spoofax
* http://yellowgrass.org/project/SpoofaxWithCore

If the documentation does not provide the answer you are looking for, you may find that it concerns an issue that was already reported by someone else.

## Getting Help

If the documentation and issues do not provide the answer, and you are not sure you have encountered a bug, you can ask a question on our mailing list:

* [Spoofax mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/spoofax)

These days we do most of our online communication within the development team on a private Slack organization. For communication with users we have created a public slack organization:

* [Spoofax Slack organization](https://spoofax.slack.com/)

Please drop us a line to get an invitation.

If you are an experienced Spoofax user, please pitch in and help new users on these fora.
