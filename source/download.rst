Development version
-------------------

The development version of Spoofax is |dev-version|.

Development versions of Spoofax use snapshot versioning, meaning that they always point to the latest build that is made whenever a change is pushed to Spoofax's repositories.
This means that the development version is untested, and that older builds are not available since they are continuously replaced by newer builds.
We do not recommend usage of the development version for these reasons.
Only use this version for development, when you absolutely need its features, or if you know what you are doing.
